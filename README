Overview:

This program uses ffmpeg to do live transcoding of video for display via
HTML5 using either HTML5 video or Flash (using flowplayer).

http://www.rivetcode.com

Requirements:

-Linux OS
-PHP (proc_open() must be enabled)
-Webserver (Apache is good)
-ffmpeg
-mplayer
-The libav "extras" packages along with other codec support may be necessary
 for some video formats.
-A reasonably fast computer (live transcoding can be extremely taxing)

Original article by "apoc" for creation of this tool:

Installation:

-Copy the folder to your web directory (usually /var/www/).
-Edit the includes/config.inc.php script, make sure to specify the media path
 and that the read privileges are correct.
-Make sure that shell_exec() is enabled.
-Make sure the images/screenshots/ folder is writeable by your server (probably
 'www-data' user or something for Apache)
